# ProductHunt
Product Hunt - Rate products with upvotes/ downvotes. Built using ReactJS

I have used a predefined array of products, productsArray, you can change that according to your need. Each product should have a productId, name, upvotes, downvotes attributes.
In ProductCard component, I have used some inline styles, you should remove that since it is not recommended to use inline styles and define your own styles according to your need.
Folder Structure: React doesnâ€™t have opinions on how you put files into folders.
